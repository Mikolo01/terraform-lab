# terraform-lab
This is a terraform code used to to deploy GCP resources to the GCP console.
I have created a vpc network with two subnets and two vm which uses these subnets to create firewall rules to connect to HTTP and HTTPS. This would allow us to connect to the internet.
I also created two db instances, where one is PostgresSQL and one is MySQL.
